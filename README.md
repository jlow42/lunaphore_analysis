# SPARC Base Repository

This is the starter repository for the SPARC (Spatial Proteomics Analysis & Review Console) project. It only contains the minimal folder structure required to begin development in Codex Cloud.

## Folders

- `backend/` – placeholder for the FastAPI/data pipeline services.
- `frontend/` – placeholder for the React application.
- `cli/` – placeholder for the command line interface.
- `configs/` – placeholder for YAML configuration presets.
- `docs/` – placeholder for design docs and notes.
- `docker/` – placeholder for Dockerfiles/compose setups.
- `data_examples/` – placeholder for synthetic/sample datasets.
- `notebooks/` – placeholder for exploratory notebooks.
- `scripts/` – placeholder for helper scripts.

Add your actual source code, configs, and assets as you build out the platform.
