# SPARC Frontend

Placeholder for the React + TypeScript single-page application powering the SPARC console.

## Planned Structure
- `src/` – React components, hooks, and state management.
- `public/` – Static assets.
- `tests/` – Frontend unit/integration tests (Jest/React Testing Library).
- `e2e/` – End-to-end tests (Playwright/Cypress).

See `../docs/system_overview.md` for UX flows and component guidelines.
